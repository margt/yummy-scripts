1 1/2 cup water
2 tablespoons powdered milk
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
2 tablespoons maple sugar (powdered)
2 tablespoons molasses
2 tablespoons margarine (or butter)
3 1/2 cups whole wheat flour
1 1/2 teaspoons breadmachine yeast (may need to go to 2 teaspoons
depending on age of yeast and flour)

then set your machine to its suggested whole wheat. (mine takes about
4:10 to bake)
really, you probably could get away with just using the whole wheat
from your bread machine book then switching its honey, for maple sugar.

---ALTERNATE---

3 lbs whole wheat bread
2 1/3 cup water
2 teaspoons salt
3 tablespoons of the following:
powdered milk
margarine
powdered maple sugar
molasses
5 1/2 cups whole wheat flour 
2 teaspoons yeast
(if using robin hood flour this may end up with a monster loaf)

set to whole grain setting, 5 on my device, and size to 3 lbs loaf.â€‚ bake time
approx 4 hours
