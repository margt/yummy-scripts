Scones

4 cups flour
3/4 cup white sugar
7 tsp. baking powder
1 tsp. salt
1/2 cup shortening, butter or margarine
(optional) chopped mixed peel or fruit pieces
2 eggs
3/4 cup milk
vanilla flavouring

Mix all dry ingredients and cut in shortening or butter.  Add mixed peel or
fruit pieces.  Whisk wet ingredients but set aside some egg whites to glaze the
top with.  Mix all ingredients together, roll into a 1/2" thick slab and cut
into squares.  Brush the tops with the egg whites using the back of a spoon.

Bake for 13 minutes at 425 F (or 11 minutes at 450 F).
