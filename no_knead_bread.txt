To mod it for making it in loaf pans:

Mix together:
4 cups white flour  (or 3 cups white, and 1 cup whole wheat)
2 cups water  (add a bit more or less to get a thready consistency)
any spices you may want to add (eg. a tablespoon rosemary or earl grey tea,
etc.)
1/4 tsp active yeast
1 tsp salt

Your dough should be slightly sticky (this method needs a bit more water to
work versus kneading methods).

Leave in large bowl with cover (or saran wrap) until risen and you see bubbles
in the dough.

Then, split in half into two greased loaf pans.  Cover with saran wrap that
has been sprayed with pam on one side. or a damp tea towel.

Leave raise 2-5 hours until doubled in size (depends on how warm your kitchen
is).

Preheat oven to 400 degrees C.  Cook for 20 minutes until golden, and turn
out immediately to cool  (otherwise, they'll get soggy).
