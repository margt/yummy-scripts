Microwave Lemon Curd

Yield: about 2 cups

Ingredients:

1 cup white sugar
3 eggs
1 cup fresh lemon juice (about 4-5 lemons)
zest of 3 lemons
1/2 cup unsalted butter, melted

Directions:

1. In a large microwave-safe bowl, whisk together the sugar and eggs until
smooth and thoroughly combined. Whisk in lemon juice, lemon zest and butter.

2. Cook in the microwave on full power for one minute intervals, stirring
after each minute. This process will take about 3-5 minutes depending on the
strength of your microwave. You will know the lemon curd is done cooking when
it coats the back of a metal spoon.

3. Remove from the microwave, push through a fine, mesh sieve and pour into
sterile jar.

Notes:

- Store lemon curd in the refrigerator for up to 2 weeks.
