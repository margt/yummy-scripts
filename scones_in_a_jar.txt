Blueberry Scones Mix in a Jar

These are delicious warm from the oven with butter and jam; a perfect breakfast
food. A jar of homemade blueberry jam would make a wonderful accompaniment to
this.

2 cups all-purpose unbleached flour 
1/2 cup vanilla sugar *
1/4 cup nonfat dry milk powder 
2 teaspoons baking powder 
1 teaspoon dried lemon peel 
1/4 teaspoon salt 
1/3 cup shortening 
1 cup dried blueberries

Stir together flour, sugar, milk, baking powder, lemon peel and salt. Cut in
shortening using a pastry cutter or fork until the mixture resembles coarse
crumbs. Stir in berries. Layer into a 1-quart canning jar, tapping gently on
the counter between layers to settle before adding the next. Add additional
dried blueberries to fill in small gaps if necessary. Stores at room
temperature for up to 6 weeks, or freeze for up to 6 months.

* To make vanilla sugar, fill a 1-quart jar with sugar. Split a vanilla bean in
* half lengthwise and add both halves to the sugar. Flavor gets better after a
* couple of weeks, and it will keep as long as regular sugar.

Blueberry Scones:

Place jar contents in a large mixing bowl. Add 1 beaten egg and 1/4 cup water;
stir just until moistened. Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and
quickly knead gently for 12 to 15 strokes or until nearly smooth. Pat to
1/2-inch thickness. Cut into desired shape and place 1 inch apart on an
ungreased baking sheet. Brush with milk. Bake at 400 degrees F for 12-15
minutes or until golden. Transfer to a rack to cool slightly and serve warm.
